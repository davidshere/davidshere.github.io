Everyone wants to talk about Social Housing, and for good reason! It can be a major key to fixing our housing market and creating real affordable housing.

Unfortunately some advocates are more focused on their ideological hobby horses than actually getting anything done. Ignore them. Social Housing can work - if you take it seriously.

There are a lot of different definitions of Social Housing - mine is that it's a model of housing development where the state plays a bigger role in financing and building housing for the sake of the common good. The housing that gets built is mixed income, including a lot of market rate as well as below market rate. The money from market rate that would have gone into profits instead goes to subsidize the BMR rents.

This is as opposed to the for-profit model, where housing only gets built if a private actor believes they can make enough money on it to justify the investment and the risk. (Note that under the current system most "affordable" and "nonprofit" housing still operates under a for-profit model.)

Naturally, even people who agree on this top-level goal - we should do Social Housing - disagree on what it means and how to do it.

The short version is, if you assume massive subsidies, rents that are too low, and fantasy financing then you're not building anything, you're just navel gazing. BUT if you assume normal buildings conditions with ~50% market rate, you can actually get it done.

A new report out of San Francisco shows exactly how 
In the last week or so, Dean Preston, the soon-to-be unemployed YIMBY bÃªte noire out of San Francisco has been posting about Social Housing, including a new report

## Berkeley's Real-er Study
The City of Berkeley recently commissioned a [similar analysis](https://berkeleyca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2024-05-21%20Special%20Item%2001%20Residential%20Feasibility%20Analysis.pdf) - not of Social Housing, but of housing feasability in general. The results are pretty bleak! The topline is that under current conditions, nothing but student housing can get built. You'd need construction or financing costs to come down (good) or rents to go up (bad) in order for anything to pencil. Now, student housing is great, it helps, but it's not enough.

In some ways, the report is too optimistic and in other ways it's too pessimistic. But it's all governed by a single assumption: That in order for a project to pencil, it needs to achieve a Yield-on-Cost of 6%. That means if you build a building for $1 million, it needs to net $60,000/year in rent or $5,000/month. The consultants looked at a fourplex that cost about $3.2 million to build, but only netted ~$10,500/month - not enough.

BUT! What if you relaxed that 6% assumption? What if the building was built by an entity that cared about housing the community and not returning cash to investors? It turns out that if you don't have to do that six, if you do say one or two percent, not only does a lot more housing pencil BUT it pencils with a lot below market rate units included in the mix.

For example...

### 10-Unit Multifamily Property
If you assume a 2% yield on cost, with the same development assumptions as the for-profit estimate, you can make a ten unit pencil at 60% below market rate.

#### 1 Bedroom Units

| Unit Type | Unit Count | Monthly Rent |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Market Rate | 2          | $3,000       |
| 80% AMI  | 1          | $2,096       |
| 50% AMI       | 2          | $1,332       |

#### 2 Bedroom Units

| Unit Type | Unit Count | Monthly Rent |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Market Rate        | 2          | $4,100       |
| 80% AMI        | 2          | $2,332       |
| 50% AMI       | 1          | $1,473       |

With this configuration of units, yield on cost is just over 2%. Note that I haven't changed any other assumptions - land costs, construction costs, even financing costs are all the same. So instead of assuming 1% loans from...some place...this project could go get a regular bank loan and pay regular bank interest.

## The Sticky Wicket: Public Subsidy
Berkeley's feasability study assumed that 55% of the project would be financed, with the rest coming in as equity. At around $8 million to build, that means the city would have to come up with $3.6 million, or $360,000/unit, OR $600,000/affordable unit. That first number is in the ballpark of what the city pays to build a new unit of affordable housing. That second number is not.

On the other hand, the project would be returning you $164,000/year. Some of that will need to go maintainance and repairs, and some of it could be used to help finance additional building.

One major challenge here is that housing like this likely wouldn't be eligible for the normal funding sources that affordable housing developers use, since the project wouldn't be 100% affordable. 

And here's the part of Social Housing that I haven't wrapped my head around yet - how do you build it without needing unrealistic amounts of public subsidy? My assumption is that neither Uncle Sam or Uncle Gavin are going to come rain down cash to let us build mixed-income housing. And the whole point of having projects that include market rate is that you can get a cross-subsidy going on.

Are projects financed 55% with traditional bank loans at 45% with a city bond? And then excess rents go to pay back the bond? Is 60% BMR actually not realistic because you need more cross-subsidy than that?

I'm looking forward to the results _another_ study commissioined by the city that looks at Social Housing in particular.
